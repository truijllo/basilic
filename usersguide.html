<h2>Technical overview</h2>

BibTex-like publication records (title, authors, year, journal, ...) are stored in a database, and
web pages are automatically generated from the database using <code>php</code> scripts. Publications
can be added, edited or deleted using an intranet-based 
back-office interface. All local users have access to all
publications -- publications are not managed by their "owner" or by a dedicated administrator. This
policy can of course be changed, but this freedom ensures an up-to-date server and presents no
problems in pratice.

<p>
Each publication has its own associated directory, located in the public (web browseable) section of
the server. The directories are created automatically when publications are added and include an
<code>index.php</code> file which is the publication associated web page. These directories are
organized by year, and have names generated from the initials of the authors' surnames, such as
<code>ABC04</code>. To add documents, authors have to use the file module in the intranet pages. 
References to these files will automatically be added on the publication's associated web page. 
The key feature of the <code>BasilicPlus</code> server is that it handles access to files so as
private files can be regularly stored as simply as the others on the server, without any public 
publication. 
</p>


<a name="documents"></a> <h2>Associated documents</h2>

The types of the documents are inferred from their file extensions. Compressed files (final
extensions <code>.gz, .zip, .Z, bz2, bz</code>) are also supported (if the original file extension
is supported). The following extensions and types are supported:

<ul>
 <li><code>txt</code> : full text</li>
 <li><code>pdf</code> : acrobat pdf format</li>
 <li><code>ps</code> : postscript</li>
 <li><code>ppt,pps</code> : powerpoint</li>
 <li><code>jpg, jpeg, png, tif, tiff, gif, bmp, ppm, xbm, xpm, psd</code> : images</li>
 <li><code>mpg, mpeg, avi, mov, wmv, qt, mp4</code> : movies</li>
</ul>

All of these documents are automatically included as links in the publication's dedicated page,
accessible through small icons. Clicking on the "update" button at the bottom of the publication's
page updates the web page when new associated documents have been added. A thumbnail is
automatically generated for images (and almost automatically for movies). The first image thumbnail
(in alphabetical order) is used to illustrate the publication in the publications-index pages.

<p>
An abstract for the publication can also be provided in a file named <code>abstract.html</code> (as
always, located in the publication's associated directory). If your site is multilingual, you can
provide additional <code>abstract.<i>lg</i>.html</code> files, where <i>lg</i> corresponds to your
language code (en, fr, de, es...). Available languages depend on the BasilicPlus configuration. Ask your
web administrator for details.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, if there is a file named <code>info.html</code> (or <code>info.<i>lg</i>.html</code>...)
in the publication's directory, its content will be included in the publication's dedicated web
page. Here is an example of such a file:
</p>

<pre>
See also the page dedicated to this &lt;a href="/Research/thisTopic.html"&gt;research topic&lt;/a&gt;.
</pre>

These files are written in html format to allow text formatting, images, links..., but they are not
valid self-contained html files -- their content is included in the middle of another web page, so
for example the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section is not needed, as shown in the above example.

<a name="memberpublis"></a>
<h2>Members publications' lists</h2>

Creating a link to an author's complete list of publications is as simple as :
<pre>
See my &lt;a href="http://yourserver/public_path/index.php?idAuthor=xx"&gt;complete publications list&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
replace <i>yourserver, public_path</i> and <i>xx</i> by the appropriate values (<code>idAuthor</code> is displayed at the bottom of the
author edition page).

<h3>Display publication query results</h3>

The results of more complex queries can be included in any web page. Authors can for instance list
their publications in 2004 (for instance in their home page) with a line like :

<pre>
&lt;?php
  include("@@PublicationsPath@@/publiUtils.php");
  displayPublications( array("author"=&gt;"last name here", "year"=&gt;2004) );
?&gt;
</pre>

Or, to include a bibTex reference to a specific publication, use a line like:
<pre>
&lt;?php
  include("@@PublicationsPath@@publiUtils.php");
  displayPublications( array("bibtex"=&gt;"XYZ04", "display"=&gt;"bibtex") );
?&gt;
</pre>

<p>
You need to add <code>CSS/listpubli.css</code> to the list of style sheets at the beginning
of your file for proper formatting (or create your own one). Note that depending on your php include
configuration, you may have to specify a relative path to <code>publiUtils.php</code>.
</p>

The following table summarizes the different options that can be passed to the
<code>displayPublications</code> function:
<table>
<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>author</code></td><td>Exact last name of one of the authors.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>bibtex</code></td><td>BibTex key (as it appears in publication's associated directory).</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>display</code></td><td>Possible values are <code>list</code> (default) and
<code>bibtex</code>. Same as on the index page.</td></tr>
<!-- <tr><td><code>full</code></td><td>When <code>true</code>, includes <code>MasterThesis, Manual, Misc, Proceedings</code> and <code>Unpublished</code>
entries in results. Default value is <code>false</code>.</td></tr> -->
<tr><td><code>fullYear</code></td><td>When <code>true</code>, results of a given year are not cut,
even if <code>nbPerPage</code> limit is overpassed. Default value is <code>false</code>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>idAuthor</code></td><td>id of one of the authors (visible when editing author's data in backoffice).</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>nbPerPage</code></td><td>Maximum number of displayed results. Others are available using
<code>pg</code><br/>with values greater than 1. Default value is 10. See also <code>fullYear</code>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>pg</code></td><td>When more there are more than <code>nbPerPage</code> results, defines the
displayed page.<br/>A -1 value means display all results. Default value is 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>query</code></td><td>For gurus only : direct specification of the sql query. Requires a knowledge
of the database structure.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>title</code></td><td>A part of the title or of keywords (case insensitive).</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>year</code></td><td>Year of publication.</td></tr>
</table>

All the provided parameters act as restrictions and are "anded" in the query:
an <code>array("author"=&gt;"foo", "year"=&gt;2004)</code> parameter means foo's publications in 2004
for instance.

<br/><br/>

For each year, the results are sorted alphabetically according to the title of the publication. A
sorting according to the month is impossible since this field may be missing, or given as
"jan--apr". Displaying the <i>n</i> last publications is hence impossible. However, one can use:

<pre>
  displayPublications( array("author"=&gt;"last name here", "nbPerPage"=&gt;5, "fullYear"=&gt;true) );
</pre>

Which will display at least 5 publications, but will continue until the last publication of the last
printed year is entirely displayed, since there is no reason to cut the display in the middle of this
alphabetical listing.


<a name="otherdocuments"></a>
<h2>Other documents</h2>

The publication's associated directory may also be the natural place to store other files associated
with the publication, such a figures or tex files. Put these files in a subdirectory -- only files
located at the root of the publication directory are automatically referenced. The subdirectory may
be referenced by <code>info.html</code> if you wish, and it can also be protected by a password. Add
a few links to the nicest images of this subdirectory to make them appear in the publication's
dedicated page.

<a name="bibtex"></a>
<h2>BibTeX standards</h2>

The publication entry types and their optional and required fields are those used by the <a
href="http://bibliographic.openoffice.org/bibtex-defs.html">BibTeX standard styles</a>. However,
some optional fields have been made required:

<ul>
<li><b>year</b> : which was optional for <i>booklet, manual, misc, unpublished</i>.</li>
<li><b>title</b> : which was optional for <i>misc</i>.</li>
<li><b>author</b> : which was optional for <i>booklet, manual, misc.</i></li>
<li><b>editor</b> : which was optional for <i>proceedings</i>, and is provided by the author list.<br/>
Removed from <i>book</i> and <i>inbook</i> where author replaces it.</li>
</ul>

The displayed entries thus satisfy the standard BibTeX rules, although the accepted input rules are
slightly more restrictive.

<p>
There is also a facility to initialize the publications database from an existing BibTeX file -- see
<code>Import/bibtex2table</code> in the distribution.

<a name="export"></a>
<h2>Export</h2>
Export is available in bibtex or full text. Simply click on the link "Download the List"
<!-- Export is available in bibTex as well as in XML formats. Current XML DTD corresponds to the <a
href="http://publicnrs.inist.fr">PubliCNRS</a> format, used by most french labs. Change the script
or use an XSLT to change the format.

<p>
See the <a href="cnrs.html">PubliCNRS export guide</a> (in french).
