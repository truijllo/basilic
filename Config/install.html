 <h1>Installation instructions</h1>
</div>

The configuration process is done using the <code>configure</code> bash script. The first lines of
this script contain all configuration options. The first part of the configuration process checks
your server configuration. Now go to the <code>BasilicPlus-1.0</code> directory and type:

<pre>
> ./configure
</pre>

This will create the <a href="checkConfig.php"><code>checkConfig.php</code></a> file in the current
directory. Open this file in an other browser to see the results of the test suite. Make sure you
access this file through your web server using an URL like
<code>http://your-server/pathToBasilic/BasilicPlus-1.0/checkConfig.php</code> and not as a
<code>file://</code>, so that php scripts are properly interpreted.


<h2>php configuration</h2>

If <a href="checkConfig.php"><code>checkConfig.php</code></a> displays as an empty page in your
browser, first check that the file is present and readable. Then, tune your apache-php configuration
and make sure Apache handles php scripts: Your <code>httpd.conf</code> should especially contain a
line like:

<pre>
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
</pre>

Make a simple test by creating a <code>test.php</code> file that simply contains the following
line. It should display complete php and apache server configuration details:
<pre>
&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;
</pre>

<h2 id="mysql">mySQL configuration</h2>

Once php is set, you need to create a new dedicated database in mySQL <!-- (skip this part if you are
updating an existing <code>Basilic</code> system, see the <a href="#update">update section</a>). -->
Sufficient priviledges are required to do this (ask your web admin if needed) :

<pre>
mysql -uroot -p  (add the "-h your.web.server" option if you use the mySQL server remotely)
Enter password : ******
mysql> CREATE DATABASE basilic DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;  (if you use an other name, change mysqlDatabase value in configure)
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> USE basilic;
Database changed
</pre>

Then cut and paste the content of <a href="Config/tables.txt">tables.txt</a> in your mySQL console
in order to create the nine tables in this database : <code>publis, docs, authors, equip, projects, publidocs, publiauthors, publiequip, status</code>.

<p>
Finally, create two new users who will have access to this database: <code>www</code> is only
allowed to select (used by web site visitors) while <code>intranet</code> can edit the database
(local administration):
</p>

<pre>
mysql> GRANT SELECT ON basilic.* TO 'www'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'www';
mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON basilic.* TO 'intranet'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'choose an intranet password';
</pre>

The names and passwords can of course be changed (compulsory for the intranet password).

<p>
Once all this is done, quit mySQL (using <code>quit;</code>) and edit the mySQL section of
<code>configure</code> to update the users' names and passwords. Run <code>configure</code> once
more to update <code>checkConfig.php</code> and correct possible problems as indicated in this page
before proceeding.
</p>

<h2>Thumbnail creation using <code>convert</code></h2>

ImageMagick's <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org"><code>convert</code></a> must be installed for
automatic thumbnail creation. The apache user (who is running the web server) should be able to run
it from <code>php</code> scripts.

<p>
Install <code>convert</code> on your web server, optionnaly change <code>ConvertCommand</code>
command line in <code>configure</code>. Re-run <code>configure</code> and check its results in
<a href="checkConfig.php"><code>checkConfig.php</code></a> until a thumbnail is created.
</p>


<h2>File hierarchy</h2>

The publication web server hierarchy is divided into a public part (publications associated pages
and index pages) and an intranet part (database edition pages). Access to the intranet part should
be limited to local users. See the apache <code>htaccess</code> documentation for details on
protected web directories.

<p>
Edit the directory configuration section of <code>configure</code> to tune the paths of these
directories and then run <code>configure</code> to update <a
href="checkConfig.php"><code>checkConfig.php</code></a> and check the resulting directory structure.
</p>


<h2>Local browser detection</h2>

When a local user browses the publication pages, by default (s)he is allowed to edit the publication
data. Default configuration is to detect local browsers using their associated machine ip
address. Is considered an intranet those with an ip of the form
<code>RemoteAddr</code>.[0-255]. Edit <code>RemoteAddr</code> in <code>configure</code> to match
your local network submask. 

<p>Edit <code>Intranet/utils.php</code> and modify the function called basilic_rights() to tune rights 
to access to different services.
</p>


<h2>Laboratory name</h2>

Your laboratory name will appear on top of index pages as well as in the titles. Change
<code>LabName</code> in <code>configure</code>.


<h2>Administrator notification</h2>

Problems with the server are reported though e-mail messages or appended to a log file. Edit
<code>AdminNotification</code> in <code>configure</code> to set this. If the value contains a '@' it
is considered as an e-mail address, otherwise it represents the name of a (writable) log file. Php
must be able to send e-mail with the first option. Re-run <code>configure</code>, update <a
href="checkConfig.php"><code>checkConfig.php</code></a> in your browser and check that the
designated recipient receives an e-mail or that the log file is updated.


<h2>Installation</h2>

Finally, once all configuration tests have passed, simply click on "Install" to really install the
<code>BasilicPlus</code> scripts.


<!-- <a name="populating"></a>
<h2>Populating the database</h2>

 See the <a href="#update">update section</a> below if you have already installed an older
<code>Basilic</code> version and are currently simply updating <code>Basilic</code>. 

<p>
The database is normally updated using forms in the server backoffice (the intranet part of
<code>Basilic</code>). However, it may be more convenient to fill the database from a existing
bibTex file after its installation. In the Basilic sources' <code>Import</code> directory, there is
a <code>bibtex2table</code> program that does it:
</p>

<pre>
cd Import (or add this directory to your PYTHONPATH)
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:. (or use "setenv" with [t]csh)
bibtex2table myfile.bib
</pre>

This program is based on the <a href="http://artis.imag.fr/Membres/Xavier.Decoret/resources/xdkbibtex/"><code>xdkbibtex</code></a> library,
written by Xavier D&eacute;coret. This library is provided already compiled for simplification, but
consider recompiling it if the program exhibits a weird behavior.

<p>
You need to clean your bib file in order to initialize the databases with clean data. First, all
LaTeX specific commands should be removed and translated into latin characters. Second, you must
unify authors, journals and booktiles names to create unique entries. Four files are generated by
<code>bibtex2table</code> to help you do this: <code>authorList.txt, journalList.txt,
booktileList.txt</code> and <code>titleList.txt</code>. Open these files, correct your bibTex as
indicated, and re-run <code>bibtex2table</code> until all the entries are clean.
</p>

When the input is cleaned, import the tables into mySQL (or use the <a
href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net">phpMyAdmin</a> <code>load from file</code> option. You should add
the <code>-h hostname</code> option if you remotely connect to your mySQL server):
<pre>
mysqlimport -u root -p basilic authors.sql publiauthors.sql publis.sql
</pre>

<p>
Finally, <a href="/Intranet/Basilic/Publications/updatePublis.php?update=1&forceDirCreation=1">follow
this link</a> to create all the directories associated to these publications (since you did not use
the normal backoffice edition pages, these directories were indeed not created).
</p>

You (and publications' authors) can now move publications' associated documents in their respective
directories. You can also fill some authors's URL fields in the authors database. -->


<!-- <a name="update"></a>
<h2>Update of an existing database</h2>

Warning messages will be displayed by <code>checkConfig.php</code> about already existing file. You
may ignore these messages and overwrite your previous configuration during installation. The new
scripts will replace the older ones, which will be renamed with a <code>.basilic.bak</code>
extension. If you have changed some of the scripts, you should then merge the two files (usually the
</code>.css</code> style sheets, or the </code>header.php</code> and </code>footer.php</code>
scripts).

<p>
If your database was created with a Basilic version &gt; 1.2, you don't need to create the
mySQL databases nor do they have to be populate since it is already done. The new scripts should
seamlessly refer to the old publications' files and directories.
</p> -->



<h2 id="look">Look and feel</h2>

The visual appearance of the index and publications' associated pages is defined by the
<code>listpubli.css</code> and <code>publi.css</code> style sheets, located in
<code>Public/CSS</code> Path. To add a special header, edit file <code>header.php</code>
and modify the "own header" part.

 
<a name="help"></a>
<h2>Help pages</h2>

A basilic presentation page as well as a users guide have been installed in the <a
href="@@BasilicIntranetPath@@/">@@BasilicIntranetPath@@</a> directory.

<a name="polishing"></a>
<h2>Polishing</h2>
Make sure the <code>@@PublicationsPath@@</code> directory and the mySQL database are backuped
regularly.

<p>
Send the URL of your publication web server to <a href="notyet ciciteseer">citeseer</a> to get
referenced. Make sure search engines robots have access to your publication web pages. Check your
web server log and look for bad links during the first days.

<a name="multilingual"></a>
<h2>Multilingual configuration</h2>

By default, the public part of the publication server handles two different languages. The page
language is defined by the value of the <code>lg</code> php variable. The headers and texts
displayed in the index pages and in the publication associated pages depend on this value.

<p>
<code>lg</code> is modified when you click on the flag in the top banner of a page. The
<code>getLanguage.php</code> script is called at the beginning of each page and updates
<code>lg</code> accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Default language values are french and english. Simply translate the texts defined at the beginning
of the <code>publi.php</code> and <code>index.php</code> pages (in
<code>@@PublicationsPath@@</code>) to implement a new language.
</p>

<p>
The intranet pages are in english. If you translate them, please send back the result so that I add
it into the distribution.
