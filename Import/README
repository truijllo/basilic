The import routine is derived by the Basilic original version, adapted to the new db schema and 
improved in some parts

The import requires two main steps

e.g.  python before_import.py example.bib


this produces a few txt and sql files, txt are basically reports used to fix manually bib files.

After each iteration using we can see in txt duplication and other kind of errors in the bib file, 
so it's possible to re-edit the bib, re-iterate and so on.

After you have finished put sql files in the db

e.g.   mysql -u user -ppasswd db < authors.sql


After this you have to edit post_import.py with your db data and launch:

python  post_import.py

this will fix references and initialize some tables
